8. myflag: choose and draw a flag. This flag should be large and occupy
most of the output window. See World Flag Database. Include a label with the
name of the country and the size of the flag.

I have used other sources, as detailed in my submitted source file.
List these sources:

https://processing.org/reference/beginShape_.html
https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/27698/how-to-make-curved-line

This example on Processing creates a Brazilian flag on the screen with a curved
line and curved text using vertex and beginShape() for the shapes.
